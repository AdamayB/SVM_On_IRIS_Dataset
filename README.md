# SVM_On_IRIS_Dataset

Using the built-in iris dataset in seaborn

Done only for practice and to analyse the precision and accuracy of SVMs, and to understand the effect of GridSearch on the accuracy.... unfortunately without the grid search, I already got 100% accuracy and precision. So I will try Grid Search again for some othe project.
